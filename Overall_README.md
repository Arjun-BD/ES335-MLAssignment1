# All the tasks have been divided into folders and have been worked upon individually. Each folder contains a notebooks or ipynb files where each question of every task has been done.

The folder "Combined" has been made by running the script "CombineScript.py", which contains raw accelerometer data of different subjects split into train and test folders. The data for each activity is stored in its respectively named folders and contain csv files by the subject.

The folder Decision Tree Implementation contains 3 markdown files explaining the questions asked in the decision tree implementation section iwht the aptly labeled as per question.

The folder HAR contains the UCI HAR Dataset, which is the featurized dataset we have been provided with. The python file "MakeDataset.py" saves numpy arrays of the raw accelerometer data. These numpy arrays are "X_test.npy", "X_train.npy", "y_test.npy", "y_train.npy".

The folder Graphs contain images and graphs used in the markdown files.

The folder Task1 contains the answers to Task 1 of the Assignment. Each of the questions are answered in aptly named files. Question 3 and Question 4 are ansered in the same file `Ass1ExploratoryDataAnalysisQ3Q4`.

The folder task2 contains answers to Task2. All the subquestions are answered in the file. All answers are in file `Ass1Task2.ipynb`.

The folder Task 3 contains answers to task 3

The folder task 4 contains anwers to task 4

The folder tree contains two files utils.py and base.py. All the functions and metrics required to create a decision tree on our own are present here.

auto-efficiency.py contains code related to the problem Decision Tree Implementation Q2
classification-exp.py contains code related to the problem Decision Tree Implementation Q1
experiments.py contains code related to the problem Decision Tree Implementation Q1
