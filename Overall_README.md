# All the tasks have been divided into folders and have been worked upon individually. Each folder contains a notebooks or ipynb files where each question of every task has been done. The folder "Combined" has been made by running the script "CombineScript.py", which contains raw accelerometer data of different subjects split into train and test folders. The folder HAR contains the UCI HAR Dataset, which is the featurized dataset we have been provided with. The python file "MakeDataset.py" saves numpy arrays of the raw accelerometer data. These numpy arrays are "X_test.npy", "X_train.npy", "y_test.npy", "y_train.npy".
# The folder "tree" contains the python files "base.py" and "utils.py", which contains the modules for our implementation of decision trees. The files "auto-efficiency.py", "classification-exp.py", "experiments.py", "metrics.py", and "usage.py" have used this implemetation. The folder "DecisionTreeImplementation" contains some documentation about the answers to the questions in the "Decision Tree Implementation" subpart.
# The plots of experiments.py can be found in the folder "Graphs".
